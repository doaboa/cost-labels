# Cost Labels

A quick Chrome Extension demo that takes emails from influencers@fohrcard.com, looks for a price in the body, and appends that price as a label to the email title as well as the from field in the inbox.

Future Plans:
- extension fires on inbox, not on email open
- extension pulls price from API, so that it doesn't have to be in the text of the email
- extension is reusable, takes in an email address and API endpoint
